# -- Final Project -- Satellite Communication
## Yael Yazdi && Sapir Yehuda

The prediction of the weather and the decay of a communication channel between the satellite and the ground station is the attempt to predict the situation sometime in the future. In this project we will offer research on prediction using efficient learning systems and therefore it is necessary to develop artificial neural networks to solve such problems. We will examine the results of the study against other existing learning systems with an emphasis on more accurate results and reduced computational complexity.
